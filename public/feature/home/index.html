      <h4>About</h4>
      <p>Super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda), one of the strongest tropical cyclones ever observed, made landfall Friday morning in the Philippines and will affect many other regions.</p>
      <p>Currently we are working on an area-based relief coordination app to allow rescue and relief volunteers to make more informed decisions about where they are needed most as well as allowing anyone to post messages if they either need help, or if they wish to give help.</p>
      <p>In the mean time please visit <a href="http://www.justgiving.com/teams/PhilippinesAppeal" target="_new">http://www.justgiving.com/teams/PhilippinesAppeal</a> to help out now.</p>
