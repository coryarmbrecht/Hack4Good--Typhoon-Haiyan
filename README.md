Hack4Good--Typhoon-Haiyan
=========================

Repo for ideas, data, and code to help with disaster relief.

Currently links to Disaster Relief Apps are stored in links.json.

## Setting up for development

Note: you will need `node` and `npm` installed first.

The easiest way to install `node.js` is with [nave.sh](https://github.com/isaacs/nave) by executing `[sudo] ./nave.sh usemain 0.10`

Clone the repo, enter the directory and type:

```bash
$ npm install

$ [sudo] npm install bower -g
$ bower install

$ npm start
```

You should now be able to access the server here: `http://localhost:3000/`
